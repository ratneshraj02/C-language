/* C Preprocessor */
/*
    Preprocessor are program that process the source code before compilation

    There are several step are involve between converting a program and executing a program in C.

    The C preprocessor is a microprocessor that is used by compiler to transform your code before compilation

    It is called micro preprocessor because it allows us to add macros.
    All preprocessor directly start with # symbol.

    There are following list of preprocessor directories :-
        #include
        #define
        #undef
        #ifdef
        #indef
        #if
        #else
        #elif
        #endef
        #error
        #program
