/* Data Types */
/*
    ```
    Datatypes :- In C language each variable has define it's datatypes like integer, char, float etc.

    int a, b, sum; //integet
    char result; //character
    float PI;
    
    There are three types variable in the C language
    1. Basic
    2. Derived
    3. User-defind

    
    1.Basic :- In C language basic data types is fundamental datatypes.

    e.g :- char, float, bool, double, void etc.

    2.Derived :- Derived datatypes is those datatypes, which build with the help of basic datatypes.

    e.g :-
        int rollNo[120]; // Array
        int *a;          // Pointer
        int sum();       // Function

    2. User defined :- User definded of is combination of basic & derived datatypes.

    Useful tips of C language :-
        - All statement are enter in small letter.
        - Every C statment must ends with semicolon[;].
        - Each instrucation is written in separated statement.
        - Comment will be written in (// &&/*).
        - main() is global function, it is a function which can write multiple function inside the main function.
        - For reading of datatypes use the following characters for depending of variable datatypes.

        | -------------------- | 
        |%d| --------> | int   |
        |%f| --------> | float |
        |%c| --------> | char  |
        |%s| --------> | string|
