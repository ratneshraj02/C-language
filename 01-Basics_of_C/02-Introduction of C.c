    C language :-
        -> It is very popular language despite being old.
        -> The C programming language is a procedural and general-purpose language that
           provides low-level access to system memmory. A program written in C must to run throught a C compiler to convert into an executabel that a computer can run.
        -> C is strongly associate with UNIX, as it was developed to write UNIX operating
           system.

        -> Popularity became widespread by the mid 1980's with the availability of 
           compilers for various platform.

        -> Standardization has been carried out to make the various c implementations.

    Structure of a C program:

    Every C program consists of one or more functions.
            One of the functions must be called "Mean".
            The Program will always begian by executing the main function.

            Each function must contain:
                    A function heading which consists of the function "name" followed by an optional list of arguments enclosed in parentheses.

            A list of argument declarations.
                A compound statements, which comprises the remainder of the function

                Each compound statement is enclosed within a pair of braces.
                                                    { } - braces
                                                    (  ) - paranthesis
                                The braces may contain combinations of elementary statements and other compound statements.
