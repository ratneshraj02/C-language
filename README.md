**`C language`** developed AT & T Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972. it was developed by Dennis Rithie. It is the replacement of PL/I & ALGOL etc. language. C become more popular because it is reliable simple & easy to use. C is a procedural language it's not support OOP's principle. C supports many operating system like UNIX, Windows, Android.

C programs not only run very fast also take low memory execution of the program.

C language closely with the hardware of computer so that it's intraction become for phyisible without compormising the perforamance of computer.

**`Constant & Variable`** 

A Constant is an entity that can not change whereas a variable is an entity that can be change.

In C there are two types of constant.

1. Primary Constant
2. Secondary Constant

|   | Constants |   |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Primary Constant  || Secondary Constnat |
|    - Character    ||   - Array          |
|    - Integer      ||   - Union          |
|    - Real/Float   ||   - Pointer        |
|    - Boolean      ||   - Structure      |
|                   ||                    |

**`Keywords` :-** Keywords are those word which has special meaning in C language.

There are 32 keywords in the C language.

- **auto** define a local variable as having a local lifetime.

- **break** pass control out of the collection of statment.

- **case** make the statment in different cateogories.

- **char** is type of variable, which store the alphabets.

- **int** is a type variable, which store the (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) integer.

- **const** keyword used for the define constent variable.

- **default** keyword are used for the execution of that point which doesn't exist as per user condition.

- **do** keyword is usually use for the execute a set of statement run mininum a single time.

- **double** keyword repersent a double precision of floating data type.

- **else** keyword are use when if statment become false.

- **extern** keyword indicate that the actually storage & initial value of variable was define else where.

- **for** keyword are use for the execution of loop statement.

- **while** keyword also use for the execution of loop statement.

- **goto** keyword are used for the unconditional transfer control.

- **if** keyword's are use for the check the condition & statment will execute if condition true.

- **long** keyword can be applied to the base datatype i.e int, float, double etc.

- **register** keywords tells the compiler to store the variable in CPU register.

- **return** 
- **short**
- **signed**
- **sizeof**
- **static**
- **struct**
- **switch**
- **typedef**
- **union**
- **unsigned**
- **void**
- **volatile**
